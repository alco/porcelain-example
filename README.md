Porcelain Example
=================

This is an example project showing how to use
[Porcelain](https://github.com/alco/porcelain).

Here we show how the `sort` program does not hang waiting for EOF on the
standard input stream. For this to work, you need to install
[`goon`](https://github.com/alco/goon#goon).

Once that is done, run the following:

```
$ mix run
```
